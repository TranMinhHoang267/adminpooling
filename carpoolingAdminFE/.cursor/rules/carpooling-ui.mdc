I am a 4th-year university student learning front-end development.
I have recently completed courses on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and jQuery.
My current goal is to improve my frontend skills by building small projects and learning modern frameworks.
Please explain code clearly and in a beginner-friendly way. Suggest practical ideas and help me understand good coding practices.
